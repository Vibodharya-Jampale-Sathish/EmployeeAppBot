The main tables include:

1. Company_Login_Details
   - Company_ID (Primary Key)
   - Username
   - Password

2. Department_Details
   - Department_ID (Primary Key)
   - Company_ID (Foreign Key)
   - Department_Name

3. Employee_Details
   - Employee_ID (Primary Key)
   - Company_ID (Foreign Key)
   - FullName
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Department_ID (Foreign Key)
   - Job_Title
   - Date_Joined

This structure allows each registered company to:
- Authenticate securely
- Add multiple departments under their company
- Manage employee data within those departments

Each employee record is linked to a specific department and company, ensuring clean separation and scalability across multiple organizations using the same platform.
